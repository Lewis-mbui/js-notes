# Introduction

### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate image e.t.c on web pages.

### Where does JavaScript run?
- JavaScript was originally designed to run only on browsers. Every browser has a JS engine that can execute JS code e.g. **SpiderMonkey** on Firefox and **V8** on Chrome.

- In 2009, a software Engineer took the open source  JS engine in chrome and embedded it in a C++ program. He called the Program Node.

- Therefore, Node is a C++ program that includes Google's V8 JS engine. It enables us to run JS code outside a browser

### What is difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript?
